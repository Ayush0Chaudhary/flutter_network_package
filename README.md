# HTTP Package for Flutter Infrastructure

### Feature: 

1. AI based Error reporting
2. Hoffmann Compression of post body
3. Removal to keys from JSON to reduce size.
4. UI for DEV mode to show Loading popup when url is being loaded.


1. AI-based Error Reporting:
The HTTP package for Flutter introduces an innovative AI-based error reporting feature. By leveraging artificial intelligence, this functionality enhances the debugging process by providing more insightful and context-aware error messages. Developers can benefit from a deeper understanding of issues, leading to quicker and more effective problem resolution during the HTTP request/response cycle.

2. Hoffmann Compression of Post Body:
One of the standout features of this HTTP package is Hoffmann Compression, specifically applied to the post body of requests. By compressing the payload using this technique, the package optimizes data transmission, making it highly beneficial in scenarios where bandwidth is a concern. This compression mechanism contributes to improved network efficiency, reducing the time and resources required for transmitting data over the network.

3. Removal of Keys from JSON to Reduce Size:
Another noteworthy feature of the HTTP package is its capability to remove unnecessary keys from JSON payloads before transmission. This optimization strategy is designed to reduce the overall size of data sent over the network. By eliminating extraneous information, this feature enhances performance and minimizes latency, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient communication process between Flutter applications and servers.

4. Gives time estimate how long request is taking.
